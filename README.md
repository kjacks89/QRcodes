# QR Code Web App
This is a Web App that generates multiple/unlimited QR codes via text input and
inserts the text at the top and bottom of the code.  

## Printing
When printing, I used CSS to hide everything except for the QR codes.  The QR 
codes are positioned at the top left of the page.  These changes are to avoid 
ink and paper waste. 

### Browser Compatibility
Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.
